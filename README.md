# Open Spelling Bee

An open-source Spelling Bee game for the web.

The base list of words is taken from the [excellent list of words from https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist](https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist/blob/master/alt12dicts/2of4brif.txt).

There will likely be words you think should be valid which are not included in the list!  Contributions to add missing words are strongly encouraged!

## Other languages

This project currently only includes support for English, but I would love to support other languages in the future!

`npm install`

### Building the page

#### For development
