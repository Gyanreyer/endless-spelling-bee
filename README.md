# Open Spelling Bee

Do you take issue with the New York Times' abhorrent positions on trans rights but still want to play Spelling Bee without feeling guilty?

Do you wish you could play Spelling Bee in other languages?

Do you just like open source software?

This is an inclusive place for you!

## Languages

## English

The base list of words is taken from the [excellent curated list of "popular" words from github.com/dolph/dictionary](https://github.com/dolph/dictionary/blob/master/popular.txt>).

There will likely be words you think should be valid which are not included in the list!  Contributions to add missing words are strongly encouraged!

## Español

⚠️ I do not speak Spanish, so all Spanish translation in this project has just been run through ChatGPT. There will very likely be mistakes, so please point them out so they can be corrected! ⚠️

La lista base de palabras se toma de [https://github.com/mazyvan/most-common-spanish-words](https://github.com/mazyvan/most-common-spanish-words/blob/master/most-common-spanish-words-v5.txt).

¡Probablemente haya palabras que creas que deberían ser válidas pero que no están incluidas en la lista! ¡Se anima encarecidamente a contribuir para agregar las palabras faltantes!
